Pixie Harness
=============

The Harness is a simple snap-fit case designed to provide minimum
viable protection and operation for devlopers to work with the
device until a more firm case can be designed.

The hardness is 3D printed in 8001 clear resin and snap-fits the
LCD and PCB.

The STL files are prepared for printing, with the `-opaque` variant
having the screen area knocked-out so that it can be printed in an
opaque material with the display still visible.
